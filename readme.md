## What is it?

### Swedish Discord Chatbot

The Corona Bot project is a chat bot forked by my own RobBotTheRobot project, found here:
https://github.com/dotchetter/robbottherobot

The bot has access to the latest data on the COVID19 outbreak globally. It will automatically
push messages when it discoveres new data since the last poll. Data points include:

* Deaths
* Recoveries
* Cases over all
* New cases

All of these can be accessed globally *or* per country, upon query by commands.

## Use

1. Register for an account or sign in to Discord: https://discordapp.com/register
2. Click the invite and join. As mentioned above, the bot both speaks and understands strictly Swedish.
